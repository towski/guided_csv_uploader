Rails app for allowing the user to upload a csv file, along with location data for where the data lives.

When the user selects the csv file we display it, and ask the user to click on the rows where the data exists. 

Then we upload and parse the csv file, pulling out data at the given location.

Currently works with basic time sheet csv data.
